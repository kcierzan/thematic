# Thematic 🧞

Set your entire environment to a consistent theme.

## What is it?

Thematic is an opinionated Python CLI application that instantly
themes multiple commonly-used apps.

This command generates multiple theme-specific mini config files
at `~/.thematic` which can be sourced in any or all of the
applications Thematic supports.

When `theme` is invoked, thematic will check if your config files are sourcing the config files
generated by the thematic. If not, thematic will add lines to source those files inside your config
files.

## Supported applications

* iTerm2
* neovim (with separate statusline theme)
* tmux (with separate statusline theme)
* rofi
* xresources

## Themes

* Dracula
* Sonokai-shusia
* Solarized (light & dark variants)
* Spacemacs
* OneDark

## How do I use it?

1. Install the thematic python package
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/kcierzan/thematic.git
cd thematic
pip install -e .
```

2. View the available themes/fonts/bars
```sh

```

3. Set a theme for all your apps

## Gotchas

Getting all of your applications playing nicely with Thematic
requires some initial envionrment setup.

1. For Alfred 4 theme changing to work properly, you must have an
  existing Alfred 4 theme configured that has the same name as a
  Thematic theme

2. For now, neovim themeing requires the following colorschemes be installed:
  1. [solarized8](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-solarized8)
  2. [space-vim-theme](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim-theme)
  3. [vim-monokai-tasty](https://github.com/patstockwell/vim-monokai-tasty)
  4. [dracula](https://github.com/dracula/vim)
