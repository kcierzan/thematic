# Thematic ðŸ§ž

Set your entire environment to a consistent theme.

## What is it?

Thematic is an opinionated CLI tool written in Python that instantly
themes multiple commonly-used apps.

## How does it work?

Thematic generates multiple theme-specific mini config files
at `~/.thematic` which can be sourced in any or all of the
applications Thematic supports.

When `theme` is invoked, thematic will check if your config files are sourcing the config files
generated by the thematic. If not, thematic will add lines to source those files inside your config
files. Thematic attempts to override your colorschemes and config in the least destructive way
possible.

## Supported applications

* iTerm2
* neovim (with separate statusline theme)
* tmux (with separate statusline theme)
* rofi
* xresources

## Themes

* onedark
* dracula
* sonokai-shusia
* solarized-dark
* solarized-light

## How do I use it?

1. Install the thematic python package
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/kcierzan/thematic.git
cd thematic
pip install -e .
```

2. View the available themes/fonts/bars
```sh
theme list {fonts|colors|bars}
```

3. Set a colorscheme for all your apps

```

5. Set a bar style
```sh

## Gotchas

Getting all of your applications playing nicely with Thematic
requires some initial envionrment setup.

1. For Alfred 4 theme changing to work properly, you must have an
  existing Alfred 4 theme configured that has the same name as a
  Thematic theme

2. For now, neovim themeing requires the following colorschemes be installed:
  1. [solarized8](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-solarized8)
  2. [space-vim-theme](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim-theme)
  3. [vim-monokai-tasty](https://github.com/patstockwell/vim-monokai-tasty)
  4. [dracula](https://github.com/dracula/vim)
